    Issues around managing good keyboard navigation and keyboard shortcuts.
  instructions: >
    For issues around focus management, use `focus_management` instead. For
    issues around keyboard navigation being hard to do well, use `ergonomics` or
    a suitable leaf. For issues around knowing what type of keyboard navigation
    to implement, combine with `educational_issues`. For issues around too much
    JS needed to implement keyboard navigation, combine with
    `reliance_on_javascript`.
